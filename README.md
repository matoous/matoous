ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I am a Staff Engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/). I work on Identity & Access Management, our public APIs and SDKs, and Engineering Standards and Practices.

At work I write [Go](https://go.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and in lesser capacity any other language that's needed to get the job done (apart from Java, I don't like Java). For personal projects, I use mostly [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

There's more at [my personal website](https://dzx.cz/).

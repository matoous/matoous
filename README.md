ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I am a software engineer at [SumUp](https://sumup.com/). I work on Identity & Access Management, observability, and public APIs.
We have a team full of wonderful and talented people, so if you are looking for a job or want to chat about any random topic, reach out to me at matous.dzivjak @ sumup.com.

I write in [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
I use [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) as my driver and also contribute to the development when I find some time.

There's more at [my personal website](https://dzx.cz/).
